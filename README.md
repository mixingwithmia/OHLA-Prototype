# OHLA: Opto-Haptic Linear Attenuator 🎚️

Welcome to the **OHLA-Prototype** repository. This project features a web-based interactive simulation of an Opto-Haptic Linear Attenuator, designed to explore the synergy between optical feedback and physical haptic control interfaces.

## 🚀 Live Demo
The project is officially live! You can interact with the prototype here:
**[ohlamix.com](https://ohlamix.com)**

## 🛠️ Project Overview
This prototype demonstrates a linear attenuation system where visual data (Opto) and physical-style control (Haptic) meet. It is built using standard web technologies to ensure accessibility across all modern browsers.

### Key Features:
* **Interactive Slider:** A high-precision linear interface for signal attenuation.
* **Optical Feedback:** Real-time visual response to user input.
* **Web-Optimized:** Lightweight and responsive design.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `OHLA-prototype.html`: The core application and interactive logic.
* `style.css`: Custom styling for the attenuator interface.
* `CNAME`: Configuration file for the custom domain (ohlamix.com).
