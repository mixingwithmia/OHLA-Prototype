# OHLA: OPTO-HAPTIC LINEAR ATTENUATOR

DEPLOYMENT_URL: https://ohlamix.com

SYSTEM_OVERVIEW
OHLA is a web-based implementation of a linear attenuation interface. This project explores the functional relationship between optical feedback and haptic control simulation through a high-precision digital slider interface.

TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS
The system is built using an architecture of static HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It features a linear attenuation slider with synchronized visual feedback and is deployed via GitHub Pages with a custom domain configuration.

FILE_STRUCTURE
The repository contains index.html as the site entry point and OHLA-prototype.html as the core interactive module. Visual styling and interface logic are handled by style.css, while the CNAME file manages domain routing.

LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT
To run this project on a local machine, clone the repository using the command: 
git clone https://github.com/mixingwithmia/OHLA-Prototype.git
Once cloned, open index.html in any modern web browser to initialize the interface.

VERIFICATION_STATUS
Domain verification is performed at the profile level to prevent unauthorized takeovers[cite: 18]. This process requires adding a specific DNS TXT record through your domain hosting service[cite: 24]. Confirmation of these changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally[cite: 25].
