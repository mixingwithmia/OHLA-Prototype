OHLA: Opto-Haptic Linear Attenuator
Deployment URL: ohlamix.com

System Overview
OHLA is a web-based implementation of a linear attenuation interface. This project explores the functional relationship between optical feedback and haptic control simulation through a high-precision digital slider interface.

Technical Specifications
The system is built using an architecture of static HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It features a linear attenuation slider with synchronized visual feedback and is deployed via GitHub Pages with a custom domain configuration.

File Structure
The repository contains index.html as the site entry point and OHLA-prototype.html as the core interactive module. Visual styling and interface logic are handled by style.css, while the CNAME file manages domain routing.

Local Development
To run this project on a local machine, clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/OHLA-Prototype/OHLA-Prototype.git. Once cloned, open index.html in any modern web browser to initialize the interface.
